## Data Consistency AND HOW TO REALLY access database

In fact there is only one database that scales, `/dev/null`. Installation is immediate, it's the only DATABASE that is going beyond the CAP theorem, has all of it plus ability to do Time Series, `CQRS` and other critical stuff for the data. Only a safe access with our Microservice API that owns the data gateways to `/dev/null` can do it.

## Disclaimer

This project is not yet designed for production use, which is overrated anyway. Look, NPM has many 0.x projects and these javascript devs just do fine so you are not going to be bothered by unreleased / unfinished / unpractical Java API, are you ?
